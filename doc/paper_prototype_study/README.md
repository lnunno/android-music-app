# Paper prototype study for Personify
By: Lucas Nunno

**Date:** March 24th 2015

# **Part 1** (initial study)

## Script
* What are your overall impressions of the user interface. Does anything seem out of place?
* Try to search for your favorite artist, how easy or difficult is this to do?
* Look at the results for your search. Is the information here what you'd expect? Is there anything else you'd like to see here?
* Go to the artist page. What kind of information would you like to see here? Is what's here useful to you?
* Go to the artist's recent news and then go to the biography list, does this navigation make sense to you? Is there anything that would make it easier?

Start page is bare, it doesn't get me interested in anything. It doesn't remind me of music. I don't want to read any of it.

I would like to see albums of the artist. The picture for the artist doesn't make sense. When you're searching for something only the **one thing** that you want should show up, everything else sucks. I want to see all the albums, I want to click on it and play it. I could just go to Wikipedia for that...

It's ugly! Needs more color, other than that it looks good. Usable at least. Searching is easy, but the icon button is a little confusing to click, not sure if it continues the search.

Likes seeing the artist bio information in search.

Likes the interface, thinks there could be more information on the page. Not much info to get started. Would like some sort of tutorial. Took a second to find the search bar, but ah, that makes sense. The icon was helpful. Searching was easy. The results were what she expected, but there were some results that didn't look quite right. This is mainly due to the dataset used.

Artist page may be a bit too complicated. Found it hard to find some information.

Icons might be helpful. UI looks a little bland and too gray, although it does look modern. Icons might be helpful. Only two navbar items might be too little to be worth it. User was able to search easily, used enter key to execute search query. User was able to find link to artist easily, they mentioned that more artist info on search results might be helpful.

# **Part 2** (what changed)

The changes made were mocked up, but need to be implemented into the app itself. Users were shown proposed changes as a paper prototype and the original app.

*Following changes:*
* Changed the UI to be more colorful.
* Made search bar smaller in responsive navbar.

Thinks the splash page needs more information about what the app's about. Likes the navbar. Color is nice. Dropdown is neat.

Search bar is too tiny, hard to read with old eyes, needs a way to make bigger. Likes the artist information, although the information for artists they like isn't always up to date, the photos aren't the best.

# **Part 1** (initial study)

## Script
* What are your overall impressions of the user interface. Does anything seem out of place?
* Try to search for your favorite artist, how easy or difficult is this to do?
* Look at the results for your search. Is the information here what you'd expect? Is there anything else you'd like to see here?
* Go to the artist page. What kind of information would you like to see here? Is what's here useful to you?
* Go to the artist's recent news and then go to the biography list, does this navigation make sense to you? Is there anything that would make it easier?

## Comments from user 3
Icons might be helpful. UI looks a little bland and too gray, although it does look modern. Icons might be helpful. Only two navbar items might be too little to be worth it. User was able to search easily, used enter key to execute search query. User was able to find link to artist easily, they mentioned that more artist info on search results might be helpful.

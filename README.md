Prototype music discovery application for Android. Uses the Echo Nest java API along with Google Guava.

## Description
Love music? Love being up to date? Personify helps you stay up to date with the latest happenings involving your favorite artists. It also helps you learn the rich history behind your favorite music acts. Learn about where your favorite artists came from to give you an idea of where they’re going. Includes biographies, news, and blogs about the artists you love to keep you up to date when something new hits.

## Interface design proposal
**Note:** The final product will differ, these are initial interface ideas and sketches using the draw.io mockup tool.

### Artist view
Main information view with tabbed interface for displaying multiple items per artist.

## Screenshots of similar apps
Spotify is somewhat of a related app. I like their interface, but their artist biographies and (lack of) news sections could be a lot better. I am also including a screenshot from Google Music for comparison.
